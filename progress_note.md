# Project: AI Research Hub

**Date:** 2025-07-05

## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, high-quality research hub website to document and showcase various AI agentic frameworks, vector databases, and communication protocols. The site is built with Astro and is designed to be a professional portfolio piece.

## Current Status: **Content Integration & Design Refinement**

We have successfully completed the foundational setup and have moved into refining the design and integrating the research content you provided.

### Key Decisions & Milestones:
1.  **Technology Stack:** We successfully pivoted from Eleventy to **Astro** to resolve persistent build issues, establishing a stable and modern development environment.
2.  **Core Functionality:** The site dynamically generates pages from YAML data files located in the `_data` directory. This is working for the "Frameworks" section.
3.  **Design & UX Phase 1:** We completed a full design pass, implementing:
    *   A professional dark theme with a new color palette.
    *   A new typography scheme using the "League Spartan" font.
    *   Enabled syntax highlighting for code blocks.
    *   Improved, responsive layouts for the framework and comparison pages.
    *   Interactive hover effects on the home page.
4.  **Content Integration Started:** We began parsing the `Research.md` file and have successfully created YAML data files for:
    *   `_data/frameworks/google-adk.yml`
    *   `_data/frameworks/openai-agents-sdk.yml`
5.  **Existing Content Added:** An existing `index.html` comparison page was successfully integrated into the Astro project at the `/comparison` route.

### Current File Structure:
*   `astro.config.mjs`: Main configuration file for Astro, including the YAML plugin.
*   `_data/frameworks/`: Directory containing YAML files for each framework.
*   `src/layouts/Layout.astro`: The main site layout with the new dark theme and typography.
*   `src/pages/index.astro`: The site's home page, which dynamically lists all frameworks.
*   `src/pages/frameworks/[id].astro`: The dynamic route template that generates pages for each framework.
*   `src/pages/comparison.astro`: The page created from your existing HTML content.
*   `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.

### Last Action & Next Steps:
*   **Last Action:** We were in the process of populating the `_data` directory based on your `Research.md` file. We successfully added two new frameworks.
*   **Identified Issue:** The Astro development server's hot-reloading feature seems to be unstable when new data files are added, requiring a server restart to correctly load new content.
*   **Next Steps upon Resuming:**
    1.  Continue parsing the `Research.md` file to create the remaining YAML files for frameworks, vector databases, and protocols.
    2.  Create the new data directories (`_data/vector_databases`, `_data/protocols`).
    3.  Create new dynamic Astro pages for the vector database and protocol sections (e.g., `src/pages/vector_databases/[id].astro`).
    4.  Update the main navigation and home page to include links to these new sections.
    5.  Address any remaining content polishing or design tweaks.
