## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (Foundation Standards)
### Home Page Cards
- Cards should be uniform in size: HALF current length, width is okay
- Text inside cards should NOT be bold (normal weight)
- Cards should be visually consistent

### Layout & Spacing
- Reduce wide margins on all pages
- Optimize space usage throughout
- Reduce line spacing in body text paragraphs further
- Reduce side margins

### Header & Navigation
- Home page: Show "Research Hub" title + navigation
- Subitem pages: Navigation bar only (no "Research Hub" title)
- Reduce navigation bar height

### Typography & Code
- Code font: Ubuntu family
- Code syntax highlighting with colors (functions, classes, libraries) - MUST WORK
- Code example titles should NOT be bold
- Reduce body text line spacing further
- Reduce code text font size slightly

### Branding
- Footer: "Samire" instead of "Your Name"

### Theme
- Dark theme toggle (visible on all pages) âœ… WORKING
- Black background for code blocks âœ… WORKING
- Ensure code highlighting works with both themes

### Final Visual Fixes (Before Next Framework) âœ… COMPLETED
1. Card text repositioning - SKIPPED (as suggested if not easily implementable)
