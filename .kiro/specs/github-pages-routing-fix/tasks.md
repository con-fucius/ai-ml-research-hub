  - _Requirements: 3.1-3.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 6. Implement robust YAML data loading with error handling
  - Add error handling for missing or malformed YAML files
  - Implement fallback mechanisms for failed data loading
  - Add build-time validation for required YAML fields
  - Ensure graceful degradation when data is missing
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 7. Verify and fix navigation links throughout the site
  - Check home page links to ensure they point to correct static routes
  - Verify breadcrumb navigation works with generated static pages
  - Test all internal navigation between pages
  - Fix any broken or incorrect links
  - _Requirements: 4.1-4.5, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Test complete build process locally
  - Run full build process and verify all expected HTML files are generated
  - Check that all content renders correctly in generated pages
  - Validate that all external links work properly
  - Test responsive design on generated static pages
  - _Requirements: 5.1-5.5, 6.1, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Deploy and test on GitHub Pages
  - Deploy updated code to GitHub Pages
  - Test direct URL access to all framework pages
  - Test direct URL access to all vector database pages
  - Test direct URL access to all protocol pages
  - Verify all navigation flows work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.6, 2.1-2.5, 3.1-3.3, 4.1-4.5_

- [ ] 10. Verify cross-platform deployment compatibility
  - Test that build configuration works with Vercel deployment
  - Ensure no code changes are needed for different platforms
  - Validate that all functionality works across platforms
  - Document any platform-specific considerations
  - _Requirements: 8.1-8.5_

- [ ] 11. Implement performance optimizations for static pages
  - Optimize generated HTML file sizes
  - Ensure efficient loading of CSS and JavaScript
  - Test page load times on various connection speeds
  - Implement any necessary performance improvements
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.4_

- [ ] 12. Add SEO and meta information to generated pages
  - Ensure all generated pages have proper meta tags
  - Add Open Graph tags for social media sharing
  - Implement proper page titles and descriptions
  - Test that pages are properly indexable by search engines
  - _Requirements: 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 13. Create comprehensive testing suite for routing
  - Implement automated tests for all page routes
  - Create tests for navigation functionality
  - Add tests for YAML data loading and rendering
  - Ensure tests can run in CI/CD pipeline
  - _Requirements: 4.1-4.5, 5.1-5.5_

- [ ] 14. Document deployment process and troubleshooting
  - Create documentation for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Document how to switch between deployment platforms
  - Add troubleshooting guide for common build issues
  - Create maintenance guide for updating content
  - _Requirements: 8.1-8.5_

- [ ] 15. Final validation and quality assurance
  - Perform comprehensive testing of all functionality
  - Verify all requirements are met
  - Test user experience flows end-to-end
  - Ensure site is ready for production use
  - _Requirements: All requirements 1.1-8.5_

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach:
- Start with diagnosis to understand current issues
- Fix configuration and core routing before testing
- Test each category (frameworks, databases, protocols) individually
- Validate complete functionality before final deployment

### Testing Strategy:
- Test locally after each major change
- Use incremental deployment to catch issues early
- Verify both development and production builds work correctly
- Test on multiple devices and browsers

### Risk Mitigation:
- Keep backup of working home page functionality
- Test changes incrementally to avoid breaking existing features
- Maintain compatibility with current development workflow
- Ensure rollback capability if issues arise

### Success Validation:
- All 14 detail pages (6 frameworks + 5 databases + 3 protocols) accessible via direct URL
- Complete navigation functionality working
- All content rendering correctly with proper formatting
- Cross-platform deployment compatibility maintained
- Performance and SEO requirements met

This implementation plan ensures systematic resolution of the GitHub Pages routing issues while maintaining all existing functionality and deployment flexibility.
