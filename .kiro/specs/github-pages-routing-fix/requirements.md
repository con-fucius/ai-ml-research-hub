# Requirements Document - GitHub Pages Routing Fix

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue where dynamic routes (`[id].astro` pages) are not accessible on GitHub Pages, while maintaining compatibility with other deployment platforms like Vercel. The goal is to ensure all framework, vector database, and protocol detail pages are properly generated as static pages during the build process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Static Page Generation

**User Story:** As a visitor to the research hub, I want to access all framework detail pages directly via URL so that I can bookmark and share specific technology information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/langchain/` THEN the LangChain detail page SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/crewai/` THEN the CrewAI detail page SHALL load successfully  
3. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/google-adk/` THEN the Google ADK detail page SHALL load successfully
4. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/microsoft-autogen/` THEN the Microsoft AutoGen detail page SHALL load successfully
5. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/openai-agents-sdk/` THEN the OpenAI Agents SDK detail page SHALL load successfully
6. WHEN I navigate to `/frameworks/cloudflare-agents-sdk/` THEN the Cloudflare Agents SDK detail page SHALL load successfully

### Requirement 2: Vector Database Page Access

**User Story:** As a developer researching vector databases, I want to access all vector database detail pages directly so that I can compare different solutions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I navigate to `/vector_databases/weaviate/` THEN the Weaviate detail page SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN I navigate to `/vector_databases/chroma/` THEN the ChromaDB detail page SHALL load successfully
3. WHEN I navigate to `/vector_databases/mongodb/` THEN the MongoDB Atlas detail page SHALL load successfully
4. WHEN I navigate to `/vector_databases/pinecone/` THEN the Pinecone detail page SHALL load successfully
5. WHEN I navigate to `/vector_databases/qdrant/` THEN the Qdrant detail page SHALL load successfully

### Requirement 3: Protocol Page Access

**User Story:** As an AI engineer implementing agent communication, I want to access all protocol detail pages directly so that I can understand different communication standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I navigate to `/protocols/mcp/` THEN the Model Context Protocol detail page SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN I navigate to `/protocols/acp/` THEN the Agent Communication Protocol detail page SHALL load successfully
3. WHEN I navigate to `/protocols/agent2agent/` THEN the Agent-to-Agent Protocol detail page SHALL load successfully

### Requirement 4: Navigation Integrity

**User Story:** As a user browsing the research hub, I want all internal navigation links to work correctly so that I can seamlessly explore different technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I click on any framework card from the home page THEN I SHALL be taken to the correct framework detail page
2. WHEN I click on any vector database card from the home page THEN I SHALL be taken to the correct database detail page
3. WHEN I click on any protocol card from the home page THEN I SHALL be taken to the correct protocol detail page
4. WHEN I use breadcrumb navigation THEN all links SHALL work correctly
5. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the browser back/forward buttons SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 5: Content Rendering

**User Story:** As a visitor viewing technology detail pages, I want all content sections to render correctly so that I can access comprehensive information about each technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I view any detail page THEN all YAML data SHALL be properly loaded and displayed
2. WHEN I view any detail page THEN all sections (features, use cases, pros/cons, timeline, code examples) SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN I view any detail page THEN all external links SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN I view any detail page THEN syntax highlighting SHALL work for all code examples
5. WHEN I view any detail page THEN the responsive design SHALL work on all device sizes

### Requirement 6: Build Process Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the research hub, I want the build process to work consistently across different deployment platforms so that I can deploy to any hosting service.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the site is built for GitHub Pages THEN all dynamic routes SHALL be pre-generated as static HTML files
2. WHEN the site is built for Vercel THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully without modifications
3. WHEN the site is built locally THEN all pages SHALL be accessible in development mode
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN no YAML loading errors SHALL occur
5. WHEN the build process completes THEN all generated pages SHALL contain the correct content

### Requirement 7: Performance and SEO

**User Story:** As a visitor accessing the research hub, I want pages to load quickly and be discoverable by search engines so that I can efficiently access information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any page loads THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds on a standard connection
2. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN all pages SHALL be indexable
3. WHEN I share a page URL THEN it SHALL display correct meta information
4. WHEN I access pages on mobile devices THEN they SHALL be fully responsive
5. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the experience SHALL be smooth without broken links

### Requirement 8: Deployment Platform Flexibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to deploy the research hub to different platforms without code changes so that I have flexibility in hosting options.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I deploy to GitHub Pages THEN all functionality SHALL work without modifications
2. WHEN I deploy to Vercel THEN all functionality SHALL work without modifications  
3. WHEN I deploy to Netlify THEN all functionality SHALL work without modifications
4. WHEN I switch between platforms THEN no code changes SHALL be required
5. WHEN I use any platform THEN the build configuration SHALL be compatible
