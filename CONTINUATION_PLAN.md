# AI Research Hub â€“ Continuation Plan (2025-07-12)

## Project Objective

Continue development of the "AI Research Hub," a static website built with Astro, focusing on content quality, stability, and a clean, minimalist monochrome appearance. The immediate goal is to stabilize the site, improve readability, and remove visual distractions (logos/icons), before expanding features and content.

---

## 1. Immediate Adjustments (Per User Direction)

- **Remove all logos and icons** from the site (including references in YAML and Astro files).
- **Implement a light, minimalist monochrome theme** as the default.
- **Fix all color/contrast issues** (e.g., blue text on light backgrounds).
- **Prioritize stability**: Ensure the site builds and runs reliably before adding new features or content.

---

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

### 1. Fix Technical Blockers

- **Resolve the `InteractiveTimeline` error** in all dynamic pages (`[id].astro` files).
- **Test and confirm** that `npm run dev` starts the server and the site is viewable.

### 2. Theme & Appearance

- **Remove all logo/icon usage** from YAML, Astro, and CSS.
- **Apply the minimalist monochrome theme**:
  - Use black/white/gray palette.
  - Ensure all text is readable on both light and dark backgrounds.
  - Remove or neutralize any color accents that reduce readability.
- **Refine typography and spacing** for clarity and hierarchy.
- **Ensure all clickable elements, cards, and buttons** are visually clear and accessible.

### 3. Content & Data Improvements

- **Expand body text** for each framework, vector DB, and protocol:
  - Add in-depth, developer-centric analysis, use cases, pros/cons, and technical details.
  - *You (the user) should provide or approve this content for accuracy.*
- **Audit and update all links**:
  - Identify all placeholder or missing URLs (GitHub, docs, blogs).
  - *You should provide official links where missing.*
- **Enrich timeline content**:
  - Research and add more timeline entries (releases, updates, milestones) for each item.
  - *You should provide or approve these entries for accuracy.*
- **Expand code examples**:
  - Add more diverse and complex code snippets for each technology.
  - *You should provide or approve these examples.*

### 4. Formatting & Presentation

- **Ensure consistent formatting** for code blocks, lists, tables, and headings.
- **Use tables** for structured data (especially on the comparison page).
- **Test and improve responsiveness** for all layouts.

### 5. New Features (After Stabilization)

- **Dynamic Comparison Page**: Convert the static comparison page to pull data from YAML.
- **Site Search**: Implement a search feature.
- **Blog/Articles Section**: Add a section for longer-form content.
- **Community Contribution**: Allow users to suggest new content or updates.

## 3. Workflow & Communication

- After each major step, run `npm run dev` to preview and verify changes.
- Communicate progress, blockers, and requests for missing information.
- Confirm each major change with you before proceeding to the next.
